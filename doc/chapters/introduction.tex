This document has the goal of illustrating the functioning of a telecommunication system transmission from the beginning to the end. The full schematic - containing every step - of a transmission system is presented in figure \ref{fig:transmission_diagram}. Before exploring the mathematical background hidden between the steps, it is crucial to understand what every phase of the system means.
