# Transmission System Simulation and Analysis

This project aims to simulate and analyze a comprehensive digital information transmission system implemented in MATLAB. The primary script for the entire project is encapsulated in the `src/main.m` file, while a detailed description is available in the auto-generated PDF file, `main.pdf`, derived from the `.tex` files.

## Overview
The transmission system encompasses various components and processes, providing a holistic view of digital information transmission. Understanding the core functionalities and features of the system is crucial for effective utilization.

## Usage
Control the entire project in the `src/main.m` file using specific flags. Before toggling the FLAGS, it is crucial to understand their functionalities:

* `SIMULATION`: Enables the simulation script. When executing the `main.m` file, only the script for simulation purposes will be executed.

* `ANALYSIS`: Activates the analysis script, displaying and showcasing all task-related results.

* `RESULT`: Toggles numerical results displayed in the command line. It is recommended to keep this flag enabled to comprehend the project's purpose.

* `DEBUG`: Shows intermediate results that may be useful for debugging purposes.

* `PLOTS`: Displays the plots generated during the code execution. It is advisable to keep this flag set to 1 to properly understand the project's objectives.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imAlessas/transmission-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
    cd transmission-system
    ```
3. Open the `src/main.m` file to explore and configure the simulation and analysis settings. Add to path the needed folders to execute the project properly.

4. Execute the `main.m` file to run the simulation and analysis scripts.
